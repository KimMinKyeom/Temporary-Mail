# Temporary-Mail
Using the temporary mail system provided by several sites in Python

||Supporting Domain|
|:---|:---:|
|create_mail|cloud-mail.top, greencafe24.com, crepeau12.com, appzily.com, coffeetimer24.com, popcornfarm7.com, bestparadize.com, kjkszpjcompany.com, cashflow35.com, crossmailjet.com, kobrandly.com, blondemorkin.com, block521.com, best-john-boats.com, popcornfly.com, plancetose.com|
|remove_mail|ruu.kr, iralborz.bid, kumli.racing|
|get_mail|All mail above|


## Reference
- This code is based on the temporary email system provided by ruu.kr and temp-mail.io, and will not be available when the email provided by both sites expires.
- The domain that supports create_mail must create the email to receive it.
- I can add additional functions or mail domains.


## Use
```
import ~
```
